# megamillions
This project charts the frequency with which Mega Millions numbers are picked.

This uses New York state's open dataset at https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/Lottery-Mega-Millions-Winning-Numbers-Beginning-20/5xaw-6ayf to grab the winning Mega Millions numbers since Oct. 19, 2013, when it began using 75 numbers. Then it uses D3 to graph the number counts.

Simply start up rails server and navigate to the root directory to see the graph.
